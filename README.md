Exercise 4:
Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers - this is the largest natural number that divides both of these numbers without a remainder.
For example, for numbers 32 and 48, the greatest common divisor is 16, which we can write GCD(32, 48) = 16.
Implement a function called greatest_common_divisor() that determines the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
